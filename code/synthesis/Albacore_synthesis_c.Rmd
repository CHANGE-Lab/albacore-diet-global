# Trait variation in albacore diet across geographies

## Blueprint for paragraphs:

1. (Results) Describe the dominant significant traits and non-sig traits in relation to albacore age and geography sampled (Fig. R3).

2. Relate to clusters (potential additional analysis/figure).

3. Discussion - Investigate how species traits may be used to explain variation in prey use by albacore tuna using a multi-matrix approach.
