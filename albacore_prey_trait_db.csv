Undergoes diel vertical migration and consequently is able to regulate its bioluminescent counterillumination. As a nerito-oceanic species, occurs in association with seamounts and submarine ridges. Age and growth studies based on statolith analysis indicate a strong sexual dimorphism: males live about 1 year, females begin to mature at 1 year and spawn at about 1.5 years. Following ontogenetic descent into bathyal waters, at least to 680 m, growth rate decreases to lowest known values for squids. Relative fecundity is 200,000 to 800,000 ova, 2.6 to 1.91 mm diameter, of which 60 to 65% are spawned. Hatching occurs throughout the year; peaks November to March. Sexually mature males captured in southern African waters had nidamental glands in addition to the fully developed male reproductive system. Intersexual males were significantly larger than normal males.

It is sometimes associated with the seabed of the continental shelf and slope (Roper et al. 2010), and appears to prefer regions of high productivity, avoiding oligotrophic regions (e.g. Central Pacific) (Voss et al. 1998). Juveniles of less than 20 mm in mantle length occur in the upper water column between 100 and 200 m in depth in both day and night (Voss et al. 1992). In the Atlantic, larger individuals occur between 200 and 800 m, mature specimens occur in depths deeper than 600 m and most have been caught between 1,000 and 2,200 m in depth (Voss et al. 1992). Females mature over a wide size range from 70-330 mm in mantle length, and similarly for males 50-330 mm in mantle length (Young and Vecchione 2009). A mature female (330 mm in mantle length) had mature ovarian oocytes that were 2.3 mm in length (approx. 25,000 in number) (Voss et al. 1992). Sperm whale stomach contents suggest it is a schooling species (Roper et al. 1984). It is also preyed upon by finfish such as Lancet fish, Alepisaurus ferox (Roper et al. 2010).

This species may, like O. antillarum, undertake diel vertical migrations (Dunning 1998). Paralarvae and juvenile stages are epipelagic (Dunning 1998). Evidence suggests that spawning occurs throughout the year in the tropical waters off eastern Australia (Vecchione and Young 2009). Off Australia males mature at mantle lengths of more than 130 mm, and 150 mm in females, although wide variation in size at maturity exists so that even large individuals are still not mature (Vecchione and Young 2009). This species is capable of gliding, like a flying fish, above the ocean surface (Roper et al. 2010). It is preyed upon by lancetfish and tuna (Dunning 1998).
