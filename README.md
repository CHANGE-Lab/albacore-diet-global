**Abstract**

Marine species distribution modelling has greatly informed spatial management approaches yet expansive ecological scales, patchy species occurrence data, and changing ocean conditions significantly hamper its utility. This becomes even more challenging if we factor in how species influence each other through complex predator-prey interactions, and harder still for highly mobile and commercially valuable predators such as tunas. We aim to synthesise complex trophic interactions among species beyond taxonomic identity using trait-based frameworks. We therefore reconstructed historical resource use data for albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) globally and confirmed highly biodiverse diets in this tuna species with 308 prey identified to species, plus an additional 240 prey taxa identified to genus or higher based on the global data. We quantitatively synthesised this complex prey species diversity into 7 functional trait guilds using traits that influence predator-prey encounter rates – e.g., prey habitat association, seasonal and diel vertical migration behaviour – and hierarchical divisive clustering algorithms. We created models using either the trait guilds generated by this study or using individual prey trait information. The traits-based models revealed better explanatory power to capture differences in albacore diet composition across ocean basins than species-based models. Trait-based models revealed broad biogeographic signatures in historical albacore diets and expand on historic baseline information with which to model changes in albacore diets. Our results indicate that functional trait information and trait guilds will serve as useful classification frameworks for analysing diverse prey, shifting and functionally redundant food web linkages, and will provide powerful frameworks for tracking foraging responses to changing environmental and ecological states.
